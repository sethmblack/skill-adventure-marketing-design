# Adventure Marketing Design

Design high-impact, low-cost marketing initiatives that generate significant attention through bold, personally-led activities rather than traditional advertising.

**Token Budget:** ~750 tokens (this prompt). Reserve tokens for analysis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design stunts that endanger participants or bystanders
- Recommend activities that deceive or mislead audiences about the product
- Support marketing that harms competitors through falsehood
- Create plans that violate laws or regulations (including permits, safety codes)
- Design shock tactics that rely on offensive content rather than genuine boldness

**If asked to design harmful stunts:** Refuse explicitly. Adventure marketing works because it's admirable, not because it's reckless or cruel.

---

## When to Use

- Limited marketing budget but need significant brand awareness
- Brand feels boring, conventional, or interchangeable with competitors
- Launching a product that deserves attention but lacks advertising spend
- Building a personal brand for founder/leader
- Repositioning from corporate to authentic
- Entering a crowded market where noise is high
- Competitors outspend you on traditional advertising

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **brand_context** | Yes | What the brand stands for, its personality |
| **marketing_goal** | Yes | What awareness/perception shift is needed |
| **leader_profile** | Yes | Who will be the face of the adventure (usually founder/CEO) |
| **constraints** | No | Budget limits, risk tolerance, timing requirements |
| **competitive_landscape** | No | What competitors are doing for attention |

**Input Validation:**
- If brand_context is vague, ask what the brand genuinely stands for
- If leader_profile missing, ask who would be the face of bold initiatives
- If leader unwilling to participate personally, this skill may not be applicable

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Adventure Marketing Readiness Check

Not every brand or leader is suited for adventure marketing. Assess fit:

| Criterion | Required Level | Assessment |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| Brand personality | Distinctive, bold, or rebellious | Can the brand credibly do something surprising? |
| Leader willingness | Personal participation commitment | Is the leader willing to be the story? |
| Risk tolerance | Moderate to high | Can the organization handle potential failure publicly? |
| Authenticity | Genuine alignment | Does the adventure reflect real brand values? |

**If any criterion fails:** Recommend traditional marketing or alternative approach.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Apply the Five-Point Adventure Test

Evaluate potential adventure concepts against all five criteria. ALL must pass.

#### Test 1: Brand Value Alignment
**Question:** Does this adventure authentically reflect what the brand stands for?

| Signal | Pass/Fail |
|--------|-----------|
| Adventure embodies brand personality naturally | Pass |
| Adventure could be done by any brand | Fail |
| Adventure contradicts brand values | Fail |
| Audience would say "Of course they did that" | Pass |

**Example:** Branson crossing the Atlantic in a balloon reflects Virgin's adventurous, rule-breaking spirit. A conservative financial brand doing the same would feel inauthentic.

#### Test 2: Story Generation Potential
**Question:** Will this generate stories worth telling and retelling?

| Story Element | Present? |
|---------------|----------|
| Visual drama (compelling images/video) | |
| Emotional hook (excitement, humor, awe) | |
| Shareable narrative | |
| Conversation starter | |
| Media newsworthiness | |

**Pass:** At least 4 of 5 elements present
**Fail:** Fewer than 4 elements

#### Test 3: Leader Personal Participation
**Question:** Is the founder/leader willing to personally participate and be visible?

| Participation Level | Effectiveness |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Leader IS the story (Branson in balloon) | Maximum |
| Leader prominently featured | High |
| Leader endorses but doesn't participate | Medium |
| Corporate spokesperson only | Low - not adventure marketing |

**Pass:** Leader is visible and personally committed
**Fail:** Leader delegates to marketing team

**Branson Insight:** "Using yourself to get out and talk about it is a lot cheaper and more effective than a lot of advertising."

#### Test 4: Risk-Reward Ratio
**Question:** Does the attention potential justify the investment and risk?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Estimated attention value | Worth $X in equivalent advertising |
| Actual cost | Budget required |
| Reputational risk | What could go wrong |
| Physical risk | Safety considerations |
| Failure recovery | Can the brand survive if it flops |

**Pass:** Attention value significantly exceeds costs; risks are manageable
**Fail:** Costs or risks outweigh potential attention

#### Test 5: Customer Pride Test
**Question:** Will customers feel proud of their association with the brand after this?

| Outcome | Pass/Fail |
|---------|-----------|
| Customers share the story with friends | Pass |
| Customers feel reflected in brand boldness | Pass |
| Customers embarrassed by the stunt | Fail |
| Customers indifferent | Fail |

**Pass:** Adventure strengthens customer-brand identification
**Fail:** Adventure is irrelevant or embarrassing to customers

### Step 3: Phase 3: Adventure Concept Development

If all five tests pass, develop the concept:

#### Adventure Architecture

| Element | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **The Challenge** | What impossible/improbable thing will be attempted |
| **The Stakes** | Why this matters beyond marketing |
| **The Protagonist** | The leader's personal story within the adventure |
| **The Visual** | The iconic image that will spread |
| **The Outcome** | Success, failure, or journey - all can work |

#### Execution Planning

| Phase | Timing | Activities |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Build-up | Weeks before | Tease the challenge, build anticipation |
| The Event | Day of | Execute with media access, social documentation |
| Follow-through | Days after | Leader reflection, behind-the-scenes content |
| Legacy | Ongoing | Reference point for brand storytelling |

### Step 4: Phase 4: Risk Mitigation

| Risk Category | Mitigation Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Physical safety | Professional support, insurance, contingency plans |
| Public failure | Prepare narrative that embraces failure as learning |
| Negative reception | Test concept with trusted audience first |
| Competitive response | Have follow-up adventures planned |
| Legal/regulatory | Permits, legal review, safety compliance |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Leader unwilling to participate | Recommend traditional marketing; adventure marketing requires personal commitment |
| Brand personality is conservative | May not be suited for adventure marketing; suggest authenticity-based alternatives |
| High physical risk | Scale down to challenging-but-safe alternatives |
| Legal concerns | Ensure full compliance; never recommend illegal activities |
| Budget truly zero | Focus on story/content creation rather than physical adventures |
| Competitive space already crowded with stunts | Recommend contrarian approach (strategic quiet vs. more noise) |

---

- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
```
Brand: Sustainable outdoor apparel company
Marketing Goal: Launch awareness for new recycled materials line
Leader: Founder, former competitive sailor, passionate about ocean conservation
Constraints: $50,000 budget, 3-month timeline
```

## Integration

This skill integrates with the Richard Branson expert methodology. Apply the core insight:

> "Using yourself to get out and talk about it is a lot cheaper and more effective than a lot of advertising. In fact, if you do it correctly, it can beat advertising hands down."

Adventure marketing works when the adventure is authentic to the brand, the leader is genuinely committed, and customers feel proud of the boldness.
